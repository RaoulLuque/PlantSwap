# PlantSwap

PlantSwap is supposed to be a Website/Application where people can
trade their plants / offsets for other plants of their liking.

The project therefore tries to tackle the problem of many
people having too many offsets to use themselves and possibly even plants they don't like anymore. In the application one can either sell plants for an in-app currency which can then be used to buy plants from other people or directly trade plants with other people. This enables a more abstract trading process than having to find another person which wants to trade the exact plant one is looking for.

Furthermore, this enables the option to buy the
in-app currency for real money which would be a stream of
income for the developers. Another stream of income would 
be displaying ads in the app.

### Why the cloud?
The project benefits from being deployed in the cloud for obvious
reasons. For one, it is supposed to be easy to access and in order
for their to exist a marketplace for plants, there has to be a database
keeping track of the different offers. A webserver and app could then
request and visualize this data to enable a smooth user experience.
On the other hand, if the project and user base grows very large,
deploying the app in the cloud would allow for easy scaling, if implemented
accordingly.

### Functionality
Users will be able to create accounts to then create ads offering their
own plants. Furthermore, there will be an option to display all plants
for offer, search them, buy plants if the user has sufficient coins and/or 
offer a trade with their own plant(s).
