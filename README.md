PlantSwap is an application which enables you to trade your plant
offsets for other plants of your liking.

You can either find a person which wants to trade their plant for your
plant directly or sell your plants on the platform
to receive coins which you can then use the buy plants from other
people.

This repository documents the progress in the cloud computing course I
took part in at the Universidad de Granada for my masters.

The above logo was generated
using [Dall-E](https://openai.com/index/dall-e/).

This project is based on the [fullstack fastapi template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template).

# Starting up the application

## Prerequisites
The project needs a Postgresql database to be running to be able to use all functionalities. Using a .env file one can pass the application the necessary details of the database. The specific parameters to be set are found in [config.py](app/core/config.py).

The .env file in the project directory contains some default values for the database connection. Using these one can also use the dockerfile contained in the project directory to start a postgresql container. This can be done using the [poethepoet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) script `db` by typing:

*Attention*: The following command deletes and removes all running docker containers and starts a new postgresql container
````commandline
poe db
````


## Using poetry
To start up the application, one will have to install the dependencies first. [uv](https://python-poetry.org/) is recommended to be installed. An installation guide can be found [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/). If [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) is already installed on the machine, it is as easy as
````commandline
pipx install uv
````

After having installed uv, to create a venv and install the necessary dependencies, run:
````commandline
uv python install
uv sync --all-extras --dev
````
The above will install all dependencies and the project could be started using
```commandline
uv run fastapi dev
```
However, the project uses [poethepoet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) as a task runner. To install poethepoet, run with pipx installed
````commandline
pipx install poethepoet
````

Now the application can be started in development mode running
```commandline
poe dev
```
and in production mode using
````commandline
poe deploy
````

By default, the api will be served at `http://0.0.0.0:8000 `.

# General development progress of the app

The following list keeps track of the development progress of the app
and its backend/API.

## [Basic functionality](https://github.com/RaoulLuque/PlantSwap/milestone/2)

Basic functionality includes things such as:

- [x] [Setup of API without functionality](https://github.com/RaoulLuque/PlantSwap/issues/4)
- [x] [Create (secure) login functionality for administrators](https://github.com/RaoulLuque/PlantSwap/issues/6)
- [x] [Create (secure) login functionality for users](https://github.com/RaoulLuque/PlantSwap/issues/5)
- [x] [Add option for users to create accounts](https://github.com/RaoulLuque/PlantSwap/issues/10)
- [ ] [Add option for users to create ads for their plants](https://github.com/RaoulLuque/PlantSwap/issues/7)
- [ ] [Administrators should be able to delete ads of users](https://github.com/RaoulLuque/PlantSwap/issues/8)
