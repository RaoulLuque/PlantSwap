PlantSwap is an application which enables you to trade your plant
offsets for other plants of your liking.

You can either find a person which wants to trade their plant for your
plant directly or sell your plants on the platform
to receive coins which you can then use the buy plants from other
people.

This repository documents the progress in the cloud computing course I
took part in at the Universidad de Granada for my master.
